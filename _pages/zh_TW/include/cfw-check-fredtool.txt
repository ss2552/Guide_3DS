As an additional safety measure, we will perform an additional check for custom firmware. This is because using this method when custom firmware is already installed has a risk of bricking the console (rendering it unusable without recovery methods like [ntrboot](ntrboot)).

1. Power off your console
1. 按住「Select」鍵
1. Power on your console while still holding the (Select) button
1. If the check was successful, you will boot to the HOME Menu and you may proceed with this guide
1. Power off your console

If you see a configuration menu or the console immediately powers off, you already have CFW, and continuing with these instructions may BRICK your console! Follow [Checking for CFW](checking-for-cfw) to upgrade your existing CFW.

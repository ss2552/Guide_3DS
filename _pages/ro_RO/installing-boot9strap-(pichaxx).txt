<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
[PicHaxx](https://github.com/zoogie/pichaxx) is an exploit for the game Pokémon Picross released by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie), originally discovered and [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/mrnbayoh/status/744899681663258624) by [MrNbaYoh](https://github.com/MrNbaYoh).

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used to launch the Homebrew Launcher.

{: .notice--info}

This process will overwrite your Pokémon Picross save file, if you have one. If you wish to preserve your Pokémon Picross game data, you should make a backup of your `00000001.sav` file before overwriting it.

### Instrucțiuni

#### Secțiunea I - Preparații

In this section, you will copy some of the files that will be used to launch the Homebrew Launcher.

1. Power off your console
1. Introduceți cardul SD în calculator
1. Copiați `boot.firm` și `boot.3dsx` de la Luma3DS `.zip` pe rădăcina cardului SD
    + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Creați un folder numit `boot9strap` pe rădăcina cardului SD
1. Copiați `boot9strap.firm` și `boot9strap.firm.sha` din arhiva `.zip` boot9strap în folderul `/boot9strap/` de pe cardul SD
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy the otherapp payload for your model/region/version from `otherapps_with_CfgS_11.17.zip` to the root of your SD card, then rename the payload to `otherapp.bin`
    + Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it
1. Creați un folder numit `3ds` în rădăcina cardului SD dacă nu există deja
    + This folder stores homebrew applications and data; it is different from the `Nintendo 3DS` folder that the console automatically generates
1. Copy the `nimdsphax` folder from the nimdsphax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card

    + The `<ID1>` is a 32 character long folder inside of the `<ID0>`
1. Copy the newly downloaded `00000001.sav` file to the `data` folder on your SD card
    + Overwrite the old save file when prompted

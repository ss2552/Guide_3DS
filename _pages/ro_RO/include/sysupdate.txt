1. Update your console by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
    + Updates while using B9S + Luma (what you have) are safe
    + Actualizatorul poate afișa un mesaj care zice "Your system is up to date" în loc să se actualizeze. This is normal if you are already up to date; continue to the next section
    + If this gives you an error, set both your DNS settings and Proxy settings to "Auto"
    + If this still gives you an error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#finalizing-setup)

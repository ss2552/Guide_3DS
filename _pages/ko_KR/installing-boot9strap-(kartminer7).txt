<summary><em>기술적 상세 정보 (선택 사항)</em></summary>

boot9strap을 설치하려면 우선 각 콘솔의 고유 암호화 키를 알아내야 합니다. 이를 위해, 이 가이드에서는 Seedminer을 사용해 그 암호화 키 (movable.sed)를 계산해 낼 것입니다.

Once we have `movable.sed`, we can edit the SD card data of the game Mario Kart 7 to install menuhax67, which will allow us to get Homebrew Launcher access.

Once we have Homebrew Launcher access, we can run nimdsphax to install boot9strap.

See [here](https://github.com/zoogie/kartminer7) for information about Kartminer7, [here](https://github.com/zoogie/menuhax67) for information about menuhax67, and [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimdsphax) for information about nimdsphax.

#### Section I - Preparing Mario Kart 7 data

In this section, you will have the 3DS generate some data in Mario Kart 7 that will be used to install the exploit in a later section.

1. Insert your SD card into your console
1. Open Mario Kart 7
1. Tap the "Mario Kart Channel" button on the bottom
1. If you are prompted to, hit "Next" and "OK" to all of the prompts that you see
1. Tap the "StreetPass List" button on the bottom of the screen, in the middle
1. Press the (Home) button to suspend Mario Kart 7
1. Disable wireless connections by flicking the wireless switch on the side of the console or by navigating to HOME Menu Settings (top left) -> Wireless Communication -> OFF
1. 콘솔의 전원을 꺼 주세요

#### Section II - SD Card Prep Work

1. SD 카드를 컴퓨터에 삽입해 주세요
1. Luma3DS `.zip`안에 있는 `boot.firm`과 `boot.3dsx`를 SD 카드의 루트에 복사해 주세요
    * The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. SD 카드이 루트에 `boot9strap` 라는 이름으로 새 폴더를 생성해 주세요
1. SD 카드에 있는 `/boot9strap/` 폴더에 boot9strap `.zip` 파일 안에 압축되있는 `boot9strap.firm`과 `boot9strap.firm.sha`을 복사해 주세요
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. SD 카드의 루트에 `3ds` 폴더가 없을 경우 폴더를 만들어 주세요
    * This folder stores homebrew applications and data; it is different from the `Nintendo 3DS` folder that the console automatically generates
1. Copy the `nimdsphax` folder from the nimdsphax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `menuhax67_installer.3dsx` from the menuhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy Launcher.dat from the folder for your model and region inside the menuhax `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Keep your SD card inserted in your computer, as it is still required in the next section

#### Section III - Installing Kartminer7

1. Extract the Release_BETA_mk7 `.zip` to **somewhere on your computer** (i.e. your desktop)
1. Copy your `movable.sed` file to the `resources` folder of the Release_BETA_mk7 folder
    * Ensure that the file is named exactly `movable.sed`
1. Open the `backup` folder inside of the Release_BETA_mk7 folder
1. Double-click on the BACKUP `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region (e.g. backup_USA.bat if you have a USA copy of Mario Kart 7)
    * If you are unsure of your console region, you can check System Settings. U = USA; E = EUR, J = JPN
    * If you get a message from Windows Defender, click "More info", "Run anyway", then press any key to continue
    * If the backup was successful, you should see a new folder appear
    * If you wish to restore this data at a later date (after finishing this guide), insert your SD card and double-click on the RESTORE `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region
1. Go back to the Release_BETA_mk7 folder, then double-click on the `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region (e.g. USA.bat if you have a USA copy of Mario Kart 7)
1. SD 카드를 콘솔에 다시 삽입해 주세요

    * If you see the red/blue/white screens but the 3DS crashes, just reboot and try again
    * If you don't see ANY colours, change your system language (if possible), then try the exploit again
1. If the exploit was successful, the 3DS will have booted into the 3DS ROP xPloit Injector

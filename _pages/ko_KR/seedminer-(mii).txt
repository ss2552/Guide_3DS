This method requires a reasonably powerful GPU (any dedicated graphics card made in the last few years) and the ability to use a command line. If you don't know what those are or do not have the hardware necessary, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp), open the "#mii-mining-assistance" channel and provide the following:
+ Your Mii QR code, uploaded directly to Discord (do not take a screenshot or a photo of the image, just send the HNI_XXXX.JPG image itself)
+ Your console's ID0 (the name of the 32-character folder directly inside of Nintendo 3DS - see [this troubleshooting section](https://3ds.hacks.guide/troubleshooting#seedminer) if you have multiple)
+ Your console model (e.g. 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, New3DS, New3DS XL, New2DS XL)
+ Your console's approximate year of manufacturing (it may be present behind the frontplate or backplate; if you don't know, just guess - it's not super important)

boot9strap을 설치하려면 우선 각 콘솔의 고유 암호화 키를 알아내야 합니다. 이를 위해, 이 가이드에서는 Seedminer을 사용해 그 암호화 키 (movable.sed)를 계산해 낼 것입니다.

Because we do not have access to the Friends List, we are deriving the first part of `movable.sed` using a Mii QR code instead of by performing a two-way friend exchange.

Seedminer이 정확히 어떻게 작동하는지 배우고 싶다면 [이 프레젠테이션](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3)을 참고할 수 있습니다.

## 진행 방법

If you are on Linux or macOS, replace `py -3` with `python3` in all commands.

### 준비물

+ 최신 버전의 [Seedminer](https://github.com/zoogie/seedminer/releases/latest) (Seedminer `.zip` 파일)
+ Any 3.x version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
    + If you are on Linux, you likely already have Python 3. Check by opening a terminal and entering `python3 -V`. If this returns a version number, it will work for this guide.

### 섹션 I - 준비 작업

In this section, you will set up Seedminer and obtain your console's files that are needed for mining.

1. Extract the contents of the Seedminer `.zip` and move the folder with your operating system's name to anywhere on your PC
    + Keep this location handy, as this Seedminer folder will be where multiple other files are placed
1. In the Seedminer folder, hold SHIFT and right-click anywhere in the folder's empty space, then click the option that opens Terminal, PowerShell, or Command Prompt
1. In the command line window, type `py -3 -m pip install pycryptodomex`, hit ENTER, and allow it to install
    + If this command fails with the error `No module named pip`, you must manually install pip. The methods to do this can be found on [this page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
1. Power on your console while the SD card is inserted
1. Open the Mii Maker app
1. Tap the "QR Code/Image Options" button
1. Tap "Save Mii as QR Code"
1. Select a Mii Character **that was created on this console, NOT imported from another console** (make a new one first if you don't have any), and press "OK"
1. 콘솔의 전원을 꺼 주세요
1. SD 카드를 컴퓨터에 삽입해 주세요
1. SD 카드의 `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더를 열어 주세요
1. Nintendo 3DS 폴더 안에 있는 32자리 폴더 이름을 복사해 주세요
    + 이 32자리 이름은 콘솔마다 다릅니다
    + 여러 개의 32자리 폴더 이름이 보인다면, [이 안내](troubleshooting#seedminer)를 따라주세요.
    + `private`이라는 폴더가 있다면 무시해 주세요

	![]({{ "/images/screenshots/seedminer/id0-example.png" | absolute_url }})
	{: .notice--info}
1. 나중에 사용하기 위해 이 32자리 이름을 [문서에](/images/screenshots/seedminer/text-document.png) 저장해 주세요
    + 이 폴더의 이름을 "ID0"라고 부릅니다. 이 가이드는 이후 이 이름을 ID0으로 호칭하니, 참고해 주시기 바랍니다
1. Navigate to the `DCIM` folder on the SD card
1. Look for the QR Code, which will be a `.JPG` file starting with `HNI`
    + You may have many other files in here already if you use the Nintendo 3DS Camera app
1. Copy this file to the Seedminer folder on your PC

### Section II - Processing Mii QR and Mining

In this section, you will turn the Mii QR code into a usable file and mine `movable.sed` with it.

1. Open the [editMii](https://zoogie.github.io/web/miiqr/) website on your computer
1. Click on "Import from...", then select "QR Code" and upload the Mii QR code from earlier
1. Click on "Export to...", then select "encrypted (.bin)"
    + This will download a file named `input.bin`
1. Copy this `input.bin` to the Seedminer folder
1. Open the terminal/PowerShell/Command Prompt window from earlier
1. Inside this window, enter the command `py -3 seedminer_launcher3.py id0 <id0>`
    + Replace `<id0>` with the ID0 you copied into a document
    + Do not include the angle brackets
    + ID0을 수동으로 입력하지 마세요. 실수하기 아주 쉽습니다. 그 ID0가 확실하게 정확히 들어갔다고 확신할수있도록 그 ID0를 그대로 복사 붙여넣기 해 주세요
1. Once it completes, enter the command `py -3 seedminer_launcher3.py mii <model> <year>`
    + Replace `<model>` with the model of your console (`new` or `old`) - if you aren't sure, only models with the ZL/ZR buttons and C-Stick are "new"
    + Replace `<year>` with the year the 3DS was made (you often find this behind the backplate) - leave this empty if you aren't sure, in which case it will start from the middle
    + The mining process will usually take up to 90 minutes, depending on luck and your GPU's strength
    + The first stage will likely max out at roughly offset 1500, depending on console model
    + If the second stage (after seeing `movable_part2.sed generation success`) gets past offset 100, verify that you input the correct ID0. If your ID0 is correct, you cannot use this method and will have to update to the latest version and see if a non-Seedminer method is available for you [here](alternate-exploits)
    + If you see the message `input.bin is invalid size`, remake the `input.bin` using your QR Code. If it *still* fails, open a different browser and remake the `input.bin` there
    + If you see the message `LFCS has been left blank`, use the opposite console model (e.g. `mii old` instead of `mii new`)
1. When it finishes, a file called `movable.sed` will appear in the Seedminer folder

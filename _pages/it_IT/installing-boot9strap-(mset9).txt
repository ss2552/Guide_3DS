<summary><em>Dettagli Tecnici (opzionale)</em></summary>
[MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9) is an exploit for the System Settings application developed by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie). It exploits a flaw where the ID1 (the second 32-character folder name inside of the Nintendo 3DS folder, inside of the ID0) can be *any* name as long as it is 32 characters. Performing a specific sequence of actions results in the console executing the instructions that are encoded into the ID1 folder name, which can be used to grant full control over the 3DS.

### Note di Compatibilità

This method requires a computer running Windows or Linux. macOS is NOT supported, nor are phones or tablets. If you do not have access to Windows or Linux, you will need to use an [alternate exploit](alternate-exploits).
{: .notice--warning}

### Cosa serve

* The latest prerelease of [MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9/releases) (the Release `.zip` file)
* Any 3.x version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **installed on your computer**
    + If you are on Linux, you likely already have Python 3. Controlla aprendo un terminale e inserendo `python3 -V`. Se il comando restituisce un numero di versione, funzionerà per questa guida.

### Istruzioni

#### Sezione I - Preparazione

In this section, you will prepare the SD card data necessary for the MSET9 exploit to trigger.

1. Power on your console **with your SD card inserted**
1. Open Mii Maker
1. Wait for your console to reach the "Welcome to Mii Maker" screen, then exit Mii Maker
    + You may see [this screen](/images/screenshots/mset9/mii-extdata.png), which indicates the necessary data has been created
    + If you just reach the normal Mii Maker screen, exit Mii Maker and continue to the next step
1. Spegni la tua console
1. Inserisci la scheda SD nel tuo computer
1. Copy everything from the Release `.zip` to the root of your SD card, overwriting any existing files

    ![MSET9 root layout](/images/screenshots/mset9/mset9-root-layout.png)
    {: .notice--info}

1. Execute the `mset9.py` script on the root of your SD card
    + **Windows**: Double-click `mset9.bat`
        + If this doesn't work: hold SHIFT and right-click anywhere in the SD card window, then click the option that opens Terminal, PowerShell, or Command Prompt, then type `py -3 mset9.py` and press Enter
    + **Linux**: open a Terminal window, `cd` to the root of your SD card, then type `python3 mset9.py` and press Enter
    + You should see a window that says "MSET9 ... SETUP by zoogie"
    + You should keep this window open until the end of this page, but if you close it by accident, you can open it again by redoing this step

        + Safely eject your SD from your computer
        + Insert your SD card into your console

1. Accendi la tua console

#### Section II - MSET9

In this section, you will trigger MSET9 to launch SafeB9SInstaller (the custom firmware installer).

These instructions must be followed **EXACTLY**, so double-check EVERYTHING you are doing to avoid errors!

3DS / 3DS XL / 2DS consoles on firmware 11.17.0 do not currently have any free, software-only methods. Therefore, all of the methods here have some sort of prerequisite.

### Installed eShop titles

Because Nintendo eShop no longer allows purchases, it is no longer possible to purchase new titles. However, you can re-download a title if you had purchased or downloaded them before purchases stopped being possible.

Any one of the following titles can be used in conjunction with Seedminer to install custom firmware:
* Mario Kart 7 (common preinstalled title; a physical cartridge also works)
* Pokémon Picross (free-to-play; digital only)
* Steel Diver: Sub Wars (free-to-play; digital only)
* ANY [DSiWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DSiWare_games_and_applications) title (free or paid; digital only)

Alternatively, SmileBASIC (a paid game; digital only) can be used to get Homebrew Launcher access without using Seedminer.

#### ntrboot

This method requires a compatible DS flashcart to be flashed with ntrboot, which works on all 3DS-family consoles regardless of model or region.

If none of the above options are available to you, this is the cheapest available option. If you don't already have a compatible cartridge, a preflashed ntrboot-compatible cartridge can be purchased [here](https://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=575) for roughly $20 USD.

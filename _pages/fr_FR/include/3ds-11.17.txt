**Le logiciel système version 11.17.0 de la 3DS est sorti récemment**. Voici ce que vous devriez savoir :

+ If your console is running *Luma 10.2.1 or higher*, it is *100% safe* to update. You can check your Luma version by holding (Select) while booting your console.
+ If your console is on an older Luma version, you should [update Luma](checking-for-cfw) before you update your console to 11.17.0.
+ If your console does not yet have custom firmware, **do NOT update to the latest version** unless this guide instructs you to.
+ If your unmodified console is ALREADY on 11.17.0, this guide has been updated accordingly. Specifically, New3DS-family consoles have a [free software method](installing-boot9strap-(super-skaterhax)), while Old3DS-family consoles will need to use [alternate exploits](alternate-exploits) that rely on external hardware or software.

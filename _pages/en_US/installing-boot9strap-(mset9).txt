<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
[MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9) is an exploit for the System Settings application developed by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie). It exploits a flaw where the ID1 (the second 32-character folder name inside of the Nintendo 3DS folder, inside of the ID0) can be *any* name as long as it is 32 characters. Performing a specific sequence of actions results in the 3DS executing the instructions are encoded into the ID1 folder name, which can be used to grant full control over the 3DS.

### Compatibility Notes

This method currently only works on Old3DS-family consoles (3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS) on firmwares between (and including) 11.8.0 and 11.17.0.
{: .notice--warning}

{: .notice--warning}

### What You Need

* The latest prerelease of [MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9/releases) (the Release `.zip` file)
* Any 3.x version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    + If you are on Linux, you likely already have Python 3. Check by opening a terminal and entering `python3 -V`. If this returns a version number, it will work for this guide.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power on your console **with your SD card inserted**
1. Open Mii Maker
1. Wait for your console to reach the "Welcome to Mii Maker" screen, then exit Mii Maker
    + You may see [this screen](/images/screenshots/mset9/mii-extdata.png), which indicates the necessary data has been created
    + If you just reach the normal Mii Maker screen, exit Mii Maker and continue to the next step
1. Power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy everything inside the `SDMC` folder from the Release `.zip` to the root of your SD card, overwriting any existing files

    + **Windows**: Double-click `mset9.bat`

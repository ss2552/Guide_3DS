<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

To accomplish this, we can use the Download Play functionality of the game Mario Kart 7, using a 3DS with custom firmware already installed along with a custom game plugin.

This custom plugin will send a hacked payload to an unhacked console, which then exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

For a more technical explanation, see the following links for information on the kartdlphax and unSAFE_MODE exploits: [kartdlphax](https://github.com/PabloMK7/kartdlphax), [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/).

### Compatibility Notes

In order to follow these instructions, you will need the following:

- A second 3DS with custom firmware (the **source 3DS**) that is the same region as the 3DS you are trying to modify (the **target 3DS**)
    - The consoles must be USA, JPN, or EUR region consoles
    - The source 3DS can be [region changed](region-changing) to match the target 3DS if necessary
- A physical or digital copy of Mario Kart 7 that is the same region as both consoles
- An SD card for both consoles

### Что понадобится

* The latest release of [kartdlphax](https://github.com/PabloMK7/kartdlphax/releases/latest) (`plugin.3gx`)
* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/download/v0.0.7/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) (the Luma3DS `.zip` file)
* The latest release of [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/releases/latest) (the RELEASE `.zip` file)

#### Section I - Hardware Button Check (target 3DS)

If the camera does not open, you cannot follow this method. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
{: .notice--warning}

#### Section II - Prep Work (source 3DS)

In this section, you will set up your source 3DS (the 3DS with custom firmware) for delivery of the exploit data to the target 3DS.

1. Insert the SD card of your **source 3DS** in your computer
1. Copy `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of the **source 3DS**'s SD card, replacing any existing file
    + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Copy kartdlphax's `plugin.3gx` to the following directory on the **source 3DS**'s SD card, depending on the **region of your copy of Mario Kart 7**:
    - USA: `luma/plugins/0004000000030800`
    - EUR: `luma/plugins/0004000000030700`
    - JPN: `luma/plugins/0004000000030600`
    - Create the `plugins` and `00040000...` folders if they do not already exist
1. Eject the SD card and put it in the **source 3DS**

#### Section III - Prep Work (target 3DS)

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your target 3DS (the 3DS that you are trying to modify)'s SD card.

1. Insert the SD card of your **target 3DS** in your computer
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of the **target 3DS's** SD card
1. Создайте папку `boot9strap` в корне SD-карты
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the RELEASE `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from the RELEASE `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder called `3ds` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `slotTool.3dsx` from the `slotTool` folder inside the RELEASE `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Eject the SD card and put it in the **target 3DS**

#### Section IV - kartdlphax

In this section, you will use Download Play to transfer the exploit data from the source 3DS to the target 3DS, which can be used to overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Power on the **source 3DS**
    - If you are prompted to set up Luma3DS, just press START to save the configuration
1. Once in the HOME Menu, press (Left Shoulder) + (Down D-Pad) + (Select) to bring up the Rosalina menu
1. Select "Enable plugin loader"
1. Нажмите (B) для выхода из главного меню Rosalina
1. Launch Mario Kart 7
    - Ensure that wireless connectivity is enabled
1. Navigate to `Local Multiplayer`. A menu should pop up
    - If the screen freezes, hold the power button for fifteen seconds to force power off your console, then try again
    - If you have launched kartdlphax previously, the last selected settings will be loaded. If they are correct, select `Use settings` and skip the next 3 steps. If they are incorrect, select `Change settings` and proceed.
1. Select your **target 3DS** console type (Old 3DS family or New 3DS family)
1. Select the following exploit type depending on your system version:
    - 11.16.0: select `xPloitInjector (11.16)`
    - 11.17.0: select `xPloitInjector (11.17)`
1. A confirmation menu will show up. If the settings shown on the top screen are correct, select `Use settings`
    - If the settings are not correct, press `Change settings` and modify them accordingly
1. Select `Create Group`
    - If the source 3DS freezes at this point and you are using a cartridge, try [installing the cartridge to the system](dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges#installing-a-game-cartridge-directly-to-the-system)
1. Power on the **target 3DS**
    - Ensure that wireless connectivity is enabled
1. On the **target 3DS**, open the Download Play application (![]({{ "/images/download-play-icon.png" | absolute_url }}){: height="24px" width="24px"}), then select "Nintendo 3DS"
1. Join the group created by the **source 3DS**
1. Select "Start" on the **source 3DS** once it has detected the **target 3DS**
1. Once multiplayer has loaded, navigate to `Grand Prix` -> `50cc` -> (any driver) -> `Mushroom Cup` -> `OK`
1. Wait a while (a percentage should be displayed on the **source 3DS**)
1. If the exploit was successful, the **target 3DS** will have booted into the 3DS ROP xPloit Injector
    - If the exploit was not successful, power off the **source 3DS** and **target 3DS** and start again from the beginning of `Section III - kartdlphax`
1. Press (X) to inject unSAFE_MODE
1. If the injection was successful, the screen will turn green and the **target 3DS** will automatically power off
    + If the screen turns red, power off the target 3DS and start again from the beginning of `Section III - kartdlphax`. If this doesn't work, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp))

You will **not** need to use your **source 3DS** to complete any further steps on this guide. Any further steps should only be completed on the **target 3DS**.

#### Section V - unSAFE_MODE

In this section, you will enter Safe Mode (a feature available on all 3DS family consoles) and navigate to a menu where unSAFE_MODE will be triggered, which will launch you into the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. With your console still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your console
    + Keep holding the buttons until the console boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
    + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup` ([image](/images/screenshots/usm/safemode_highlighted.png))
1. If the exploit was successful, your console will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
    + If your console instead freezes on a white screen, hold the POWER button until it turns off, then retry this section
    + If your console instead freezes on a red screen, you are missing `usm.bin` from the root of your SD card
    + If you get a different error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#installing-boot9strap-usm)

{% include_relative include/launch-hbl-dlp.txt %}
1. Launch slotTool from the list of homebrew
1. Select "RESTORE original wifi slots 1,2,3"
1. Your console will then reboot

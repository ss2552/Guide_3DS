**Nintendo 3DS online services have recently shut down.** Here's what you should know:

+ Current 3DS modding methods are not affected.
+ The Internet access of homebrew applications (i.e. Universal-Updater) is not affected.
+ Official online servers are going down for everyone, but alternate online servers (i.e. Pretendo Network) are currently a work-in-progress.
+ Online shutdown does not affect access to the browser or to the Internet. The only thing that has shut down is Nintendo Network online services, such as game servers.

title: "Installing boot9strap (Kartminer7)"

<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To install boot9strap on your console, we derive your console's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the data encryption key (movable.sed) for your console.

Once we have `movable.sed`, we can edit the SD card data of the game Mario Kart 7 to install menuhax67, which will allow us to get Homebrew Launcher access.

Once we have Homebrew Launcher access, we can run nimdsphax to install boot9strap.

See [here](https://github.com/zoogie/kartminer7) for information about Kartminer7, [here](https://github.com/zoogie/menuhax67) for information about menuhax67, and [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimdsphax) for information about nimdsphax.

#### Section I - Preparing Mario Kart 7 data

In this section, you will have the 3DS generate some data in Mario Kart 7 that will be used to install the exploit in a later section.

1. Insert your SD card into your console
1. Open Mario Kart 7
1. Tap the "Mario Kart Channel" button on the bottom

1. Sett inn SD-kortet i datamaskinen din
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
    * The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `3ds` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
    * This folder stores homebrew applications and data; it is different from the `Nintendo 3DS` folder that the console automatically generates
1. Copy the `nimdsphax` folder from the nimdsphax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `menuhax67_installer.3dsx` from the menuhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card

1. Double-click on the BACKUP `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region (e.g. backup_USA.bat if you have a USA copy of Mario Kart 7)
    * If you are unsure of your console region, you can check System Settings. U = USA; E = EUR, J = JPN
    * If you get a message from Windows Defender, click "More info", "Run anyway", then press any key to continue
    * If the backup was successful, you should see a new folder appear
    * If you wish to restore this data at a later date (after finishing this guide), insert your SD card and double-click on the RESTORE `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region
1. Go back to the Release_BETA_mk7 folder, then double-click on the `.bat` file corresponding to your console's region (e.g. USA.bat if you have a USA copy of Mario Kart 7)

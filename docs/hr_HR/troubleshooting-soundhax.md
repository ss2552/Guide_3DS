## Issues with Soundhax

:::details Red/purple/pink and white screen after running Soundhax

If your console is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with an old version of universal-otherapp. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest).

If your console is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. You should [check for CFW](checking-for-cfw).

:::

:::details "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card.

:::

:::details "Could not play"

You have the wrong Soundhax file for your console and region, or your console is incompatible with Soundhax. In the latter case, your course of action will determine on what version your 3DS is currently on. Join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

# Uninstall CFW

## Required Reading

This will completely remove CFW from your console, including boot9strap and Luma3DS, for the purpose of restoring the console to stock.

Any unsigned (illegitimate) games will be rendered unusable and will be removed during this process. Use a [save manager](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest) to back up any saves that you care about.

::: danger

If you're removing CFW because:

- You want to re-install it
- You want to change SD cards
- Your SD card was lost or corrupted
- One of your games is broken
- One of your system applications is broken
- Your console is unable to boot to HOME Menu

<u>**STOP!!!**</u> Uninstalling custom firmware is an unnecessary risk that will at best waste your time and at worst <u>**BRICK**</u> your console. A better idea would be to ask for help at [r/3ds on Discord](https://discord.gg/3ds).

:::

::: danger

If you have done ANY of the following:

- [Changed the region](region-changing) of the console
- Installed a custom keyboard
- Installed a custom HOME Menu (_not_ a custom theme)
- Manually changed the encryption key (`movable.sed`) of the console
- Unbanned the console

then uninstalling CFW <u>**WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE**</u>. If this applies to you, [restore a clean NAND backup](godmode9-usage#restoring-a-nand-backup) before continuing.

:::

::: warning

These instructions will only work on consoles with a Luma3DS version of 8.0 or higher. If you have an older version of Luma, you must upgrade your setup before following these instructions. Follow [this page](checking-for-cfw) to find your upgrade instructions.

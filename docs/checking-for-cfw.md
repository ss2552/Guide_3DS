# Checking for CFW

## Required Reading

This is an add-on section to check if your console already has a modern custom firmware.

If your console already has an arm9loaderhax or boot9strap based custom firmware, you will need to follow the instructions indicated to upgrade your setup to a modern one.

::: info

If your console has a menuhax-based CFW setup, you should [clear HOME Menu's extdata](troubleshooting-post-install), then follow all instructions on your SysNAND. You probably have a menuhax-based setup if your system version when booting without an SD card is 9.2.0-20.

## Instructions

1. Power off your console
2. Hold the (Select) button
3. Power on your console while still holding the (Select) button
4. You should now see a configuration menu of some sort

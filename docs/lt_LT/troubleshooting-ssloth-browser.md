Back up your data and reformat your SD card as FAT32 with the recommended tool depending on your operating system ([Windows](formatting-sd-\(windows\)), [macOS](formatting-sd-\(mac\)), [Linux](formatting-sd-\(linux\))). MiniTool Partition Wizard and the HP formatting tool (HPUSBDisk) are known to cause issues with 3DS SD cards.

If this is unsuccessful, try using another SD card.

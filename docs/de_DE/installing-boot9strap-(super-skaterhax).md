# boot9strap installieren (super-skaterhax)

:::details Technical Details (optional)

For technical details on the exploits that you will be using on this page, see [here](https://github.com/zoogie/super-skaterhax).

:::

### Compatibility Notes

Super-skaterhax (when used to launch the Homebrew Launcher) is compatible with New models on version 11.15.0 and above in all regions.

::: info

This exploit is known to be inconsistent: it works for some people, but not others. If you prefer to use a more consistent exploit (which may take longer, but will have the same end result), follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-\(mset9\)) instead.

:::

### What You Need

- The [Super-skaterhax](https://skater.nintendohomebrew.com) zip for your console's region and system version

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger both super-skaterhax and the Homebrew Launcher.

1. Power off your console

2. Stecke deine SD-Karte in deinen Computer

3. Copy everything from the Super-skaterhax `.zip` to the root of your SD card. If any of the files exist, overwrite them with the new files.

    - If you get a [warning](/images/screenshots/skaterhax/country-change-notice.png) that says you will lose access to Nintendo Network ID features, you can safely select OK to continue

::: info

A video detailing these steps is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEcZB72vJts).

:::

1. Open the Internet Browser
2. Tap the 3-line (☰) icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen
3. Tap `Settings` -> scroll down -> `Reset Save Data` -> `Clear All` -> `Clear` -> `OK`
    - The browser will close
4. Reopen the Internet Browser
5. Tap `Next` -> `Google` -> `OK` -> `OK`
6. Tap on the address bar at the top of the bottom screen
7. Enter the URL corresponding to your console's region:
    - **USA/EUR/JPN**: `https://skater.686178.xyz/go/super`
    - **KOR**: `https://skater.686178.xyz/go/korea`
8. Tap "Open"
    - You should see the text "GO GO!". Do not click on it yet
9. Tap the 3-line (☰) icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen
10. Tap on "Add to Bookmarks"
11. Tap the 3-line (☰) icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen
12. Tap on `Settings` -> `Delete Cookies` -> `Yes`
13. Press (Home) to return to the HOME Menu, then immediately reopen the Internet Browser
14. Wait for the page to fully load, then tap the "GO GO!" button on the top of the bottom screen
15. Wait for the page to fully load, then press (A) to dismiss the [popup](/images/screenshots/skaterhax/skater-popup.png)
16. If your console displays:
    - **"The Homebrew Launcher" screen**: Continue to the next step
    - **A white "Error has occurred" message box**: The exploit failed due to random chance. Open System Settings, change the language to a different one (if possible), then retry this section. You may have to repeat this sequence up to ten times
        - On JPN/KOR region consoles, there is only one language setting. On those consoles, you should open System Settings, close it, then retry this section
        - If the exploit is still unsuccessful after five attempts, there may be a problem with your files or prep work. Ensure that region and date/time are correct, and that you have been following this section **exactly**. If you used WinRAR to extract files to the SD card, re-extract the files using File Explorer or 7-zip instead
        - If the exploit is still unsuccessful after ten attempts, follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-\(mset9\)) instead
    - **A black screen that says "An error has occurred"**: Your file placement is incorrect. Ensure that the super-skaterhax files are on the root of the SD card
    - **A yellow screen**: Homebrew Launcher failed to open due to random chance. Hold the POWER button until the console turns off, then retry this section
    - **[The word "Text"](/images/screenshots/skaterhax/skater-old3ds.png)**: You have an Old 3DS, where this exploit **does not work**. If this is the case, you should follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-\(mset9\)) instead
17. Launch nimdsphax from the list of homebrew
18. Wenn der Exploit erfolgreich war, wird SafeBS9Installer gestartet
    - If your console freezes on a red or green screen, hold the POWER button until it turns off, then retry this section

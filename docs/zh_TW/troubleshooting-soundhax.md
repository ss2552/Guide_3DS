# Troubleshooting (Soundhax)

This page offers troubleshooting advice for commonly encountered issues with the "Installing boot9strap (Soundhax)" page, which is used on system versions between 1.0.0 and 11.3.0. 如果您無法透過本頁解決你的問題，請加入 [Discord 上的 Nintendo Homebrew 伺服器](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp)，並以英文敘述你的問題，以及您已經嘗試過的步驟。

## Issues with Soundhax

:::details Red/purple/pink and white screen after running Soundhax

If your console is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with an old version of universal-otherapp. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest).

If your console is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. 請先[檢查是否已安裝自製韌體](checking-for-cfw) 。

:::details "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

您所使用的 `otherapp.bin` 檔案有問題(如遺失、放錯位置或者損壞)。 下載最新版本的 [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) 並將其放在你 SD 卡的根目錄中。

You may also have the wrong Soundhax file for your console, region and version. Verify that your console details are correct and redownload your Soundhax file from [here](http://soundhax.com), then place it on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

If the above doesn't fix your issue, and you are using an Old 3DS / Old 3DS XL / Old 2DS, you may be encountering an issue involving cartridge updates. Take another look at the system version. If the number before the letter is 4 or lower (e.g. 11.3.0-**4**U), replace the Soundhax file on the root of your SD card with the one from [here](http://soundhax.686178.xyz/frankenfirm.html?crash).

If none of these fix your issue, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

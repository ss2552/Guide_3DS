## What is custom firmware?

**自製韌體** (CFW) 可讓您在您的主機上進行任何軟體上的修改，好比你電腦上的系統管理員權限一樣。 改機後，你能夠隨意修改你的 3DS，而非侷限於任天堂官方所允許的事。

常見的改機用途：

- Running homebrew software and games made for or ported to the Nintendo 3DS
- Bypassing the region lock, allowing you to play games from other regions
- HOME Menu customization, using community-created [themes and badges](https://themeplaza.art)
- Modification of games ("ROM hacks") through [LayeredFS](https://github.com/knight-ryu12/godmode9-layeredfs-usage/wiki/Using-Luma3DS'-layeredfs-\(Only-version-8.0-and-higher\))
- Save data editing, backup, and restore
- Emulation of older consoles, as well as native playback of DS and GBA games
- Installing your physical cartridges for digital use

## What does this guide install?

This guide will:

- Install **boot9strap** and **Luma3DS custom firmware** on unmodified retail 3DS/2DS consoles
  - Luma3DS will automatically remove the region lock and allow you to run unsigned software
- Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store
- Make critical system file backups that can help avoid bricks (and recover data in the event of one)

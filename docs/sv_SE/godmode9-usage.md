## Required Reading

GodMode9 is a full access file browser for the Nintendo 3DS console, giving you access to your SD card, the FAT partitions inside your SysNAND and EmuNAND, and basically anything else. Among other functionality, you can copy, delete, rename files, and create folders.

Observera att om du har någon annan payload än `GodMode9.firm` i mappen `/luma/payloads/` på ditt SD-kort, så kommer en "chainloader menu" visas om du håller inne (Start) under uppstart, där du måste använda D-Pad:en och knappen (A) för att välja "GodMode9" för dessa instruktioner.

GodMode9 is powerful software that has the capability to modify essentially anything on your console. Though many of these modifications are locked behind a permissions system, and it is impossible to accidentally perform dangerous actions without deliberately unlocking permissions, you should still follow instructions carefully and keep backups just in case.

## Updating GodMode9
